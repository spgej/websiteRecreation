This Project was initially supposed to be a front end exercise in recreating the home page of IGN.com

Since getting that to a satisfactory stage, I have decided to add functionality to the back end.

I will creating more templates and refactoring the code in addition to adding a database for articles comprised of lorem ipsum.
